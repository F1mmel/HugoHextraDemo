This is a fan-made remake of *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*, rebuilt from the ground up using the **Unity Engine**. The goal is to bring the original experience to life with modern visuals, smoother performance, and enhanced controls â€” all while preserving the soul of the original game.

## About the Project

This remastered version uses the **original game files from the Twilight Princess ISO** to load assets such as models, textures, animations, and sounds. This ensures authenticity while taking advantage of a modern engine.

### Features:
- Updated graphics with modern lighting, shadows, and effects powered by Unity
- Controller and keyboard/mouse support
- Runs directly from your legally-owned ISO file
- Quality-of-life improvements and performance tweaks

> [!WARNING]
> A **legal copy of the game (ISO)** is required to play. The ISO file is **not** included.
