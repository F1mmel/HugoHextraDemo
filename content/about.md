## What is this?

This is a community-driven project aiming to enhance and remaster *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*. The project focuses on improving visuals, audio, and gameplay, while staying true to the original experience.

> [!WARNING]
> If the game is built from source, it is **not possible to play the game** without providing the Unity assets used to create it.  
> These assets are **not** included in this project and must be provided separately.  
> You can find more information on how to integrate the Unity assets [here](/installation#assets).

## Project goals

The long-term goal of this project is to create a highly polished remastered version   of Twilight Princess. This includes:

- High-definition textures and models
- Improved lighting and shading
- Enhanced audio quality and sound effects
- Gameplay tweaks for smoother mechanics
- Improved modding tools to allow further customization

We aim to remaster the **GameCube USA** version first, as it is the foundation of the Twilight Princess experience. Future goals include compatibility with other versions of the game, such as:

- PAL GameCube
- JPN GameCube
- Wii versions (USA, PAL, JPN, KOR)
- Nvidia Shield versions

> using those assets.
> The project follows strict guidelines to avoid legal issues, including:
> - Contributors must own the game on a GameCube or Wii console and dump their own assets.
> - No original game files or proprietary content are distributed.
